This system is from my IoT project for Mobilize Defensing System. This code should be run using Processing, which could be downloaded from this link: https://processing.org/
It is required to connect the Arduino to the computer before compiling the code, else errors would occur.
The diagram for the system is below. Sorry if the diagram looks messy because at the time I started this project I was not used to this tool. You may ignore 2 servos as you only need the radar installation. Focus on the Ultrasonic sensor only.

*Note that this system is using Arduino UNO. You may need to adjust this system if you are using another version of Arduino.
